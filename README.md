# React + Vite

Zustand (German for “state”) is a small, fast, and scalable state management library for React applications.
It helps manage global state — data shared across multiple components — without the complexity of Redux or Context API.

# 📦 Features
- Zustand uses a minimal and intuitive API — you can create and use stores with just a few lines of code using create().
- Unlike Redux, there are no reducers, actions, or types to define — just functions.
- Zustand provides React hooks (useStore) for accessing and updating state easily.
- You can call APIs or handle asynchronous logic (like fetch) directly inside the store.
- Zustand stores are independent of React — you can even use them in plain JS or with other frameworks.

# 🚀 Tech Stack
- React (frontend)
- Vite (build tool)
- Tailwind CSS (styling)
